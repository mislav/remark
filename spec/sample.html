<h1>Remark &mdash; HTML to Markdown converter</h1>

<p>This is a sample document which will get updated as Remark understands more HTML.
It reflects what's currently supported.</p>

<p class="nice">Known block elements are left intact if they have attributes.
Markdown doesn't have a syntax for them.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Elements that can't be represented in Markdown are left intact.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>SCRIPT and HEAD tags are swallowed, as browsers don't render them as content.</p>

<script type="text/javascript">
  alert("I will not survive")
</script>

<h2>TODO</h2>

<p>Remark should support Markdown syntax for <em>inline</em> markup.
<a href="http://github.com/mislav">Hyperlinks</a> and <code>code spans</code> are a must.</p>

<ul>
  <li>List items too;</li>
  <li>ordered or unordered.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remark should probably support BR elements in paragraphs,<br>
although people tend to abuse them.</p>

<pre><code>And who would forget
Preformatted code blocks :)</code></pre>

<div class="content">
  <p>What to do with pieces of content inside wrapper elements,
  like DIV, is still undecided.</p>
</div>
